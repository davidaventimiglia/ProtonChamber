IonGun
======

IonGun is a pluggable compiler framework for SQL and SQL-like
languages, written in Java and coupled to the Java JDBC database API.
Plugins are written in Java but are free to adopt their own strategies
for translation and compilation.  Some examples are these.

  * Regular expression parsers
  * Hand-written recursive-descent parsers
  * Compiler-compiler tools generated by ANTLR or JavaCC
