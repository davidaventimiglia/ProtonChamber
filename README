framework for relational databases.  With Atomic, the database IS the
application. 

BUILDING
========

1. Source the setenv.sh file in this directory to set up your
environment.  At the moment, this only sets the ATOMIC_HOME
environment variable.  Currently, this variable is only used by
.dir-locals.el and Emacs, so that you can use the Emacs `compile'
command from within any subdirectory of the project root directory.

	source setenv.sh

2. Run the configure script to probe your system and generate the
Makefiles. 

        ./configure

3. Compile using Make.

   	make

4. Install using Make.

        sudo make install

5. Run Atomic using Make.

        make run-atomic

6. Run Cosmotron using Make.

        make run-cosmotron
