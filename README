RadiumSalt is a programming-free Java web service and web application
framework for relational databases.  With RadiumSalt, the database IS the
application. 

BUILDING
========

1. Source the setenv.sh file in this directory to set up your
environment.  At the moment, this only sets the RADIUMSALT_HOME
environment variable.  Currently, this variable is only used by
.dir-locals.el and Emacs, so that you can use the Emacs `compile'
command from within any subdirectory of the project root directory.

	source setenv.sh

2. Run the configure script to probe your system and generate the
Makefiles. 

        ./configure

3. Compile using Make.

   	make

4. Install using Make.

        sudo make install

5. Run RadiumSalt

        salt
